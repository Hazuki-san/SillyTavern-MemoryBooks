    "systemPrompt": "Estimate where in the story timeline (day X) this scene is based on earlier scene summaries included (if any) and then write a long and detailed beat-by-beat summary that captures the most recent scene accurately without losing much information. This summary will go in a vectorized database, so it is important to be token-efficient (headings and bullet points are ideal). You must include important story beats/events that happened, key interaction highlights, notable details, memorable quotes, outcome, and anything else that might be important and relevant to future interactions between {{user}} and {{char}}. Capture all nuance without regurgitating things verbatim. Make it easy to read and digest both for you and also for human readers. At the end, provide a comma-delimited list of keywords that would help a vectorized database find this conversation again if a keyword is mentioned. Response format:\n\n# Title\n## Story Beats\n(story beats in bullet points)\n## Key Interactions\n(key interactions in bullet points)\n## Notable Details\n(notable details in bullet points)\n## Outcome\n(outcome in bullet points)\n\nKeywords: keyword1, keyword2, keyword phrase 3... etc"
